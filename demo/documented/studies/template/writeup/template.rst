The Studies Template
====================

This is where you will put a quick blurb about what this study is trying to investigate



Keywords:
---------

include a few keywords for some quick info at glance 



Input files and code version:
-----------------------------

Here is where you can list the various input files need to rerun this study and include a link to the version of WindSE that was used.
    
    * Parameter File: :download:`../../../demo/documented/studies/template/input_files/template.yaml`
    * Wind-farm File: :download:`../../../demo/documented/studies/template/input_files/wind_farm.csv`
    * Code Version: `WindSE 2021.08.01 <https://github.com/NREL/WindSE/releases/tag/2021.08.01>`_

Note: not all studies need a full release, but they should at least link to a tag/commit.




Setup:
------

Here you describe the setup of the simulation or simulations



Results:
--------

Here is where you can plop down any data generated by the study. Figures can be added using:

.. figure:: ../../../demo/documented/studies/template/writeup/wind_farm.png
   :scale: 75 %

and tables can be added directly:

.. list-table:: Direct table example
   :widths: 25 25 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Heading row 1, column 1
     - Heading row 1, column 2
     - Heading row 1, column 3
   * - Row 1, column 1
     -
     - Row 1, column 3
   * - Row 2, column 1
     - Row 2, column 2
     - Row 2, column 3

or as a csv file:

.. csv-table:: CSV example
   :file: input_files/wind_farm.csv
   :widths: 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70
   :header-rows: 1



Conclusions:
------------

Finally include a conclusion that summarizes the findings of the study and any recommendation that might come out of it such as "use at least 10 actuator nodes" or "the mesh need to be fine enough to include at least 3 grid point per turbine".
